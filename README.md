# 🧳 Reservation Propensity Intelligence Engine (Hospitality e-Commerce)

Predicting whether users will book a hotel based on their search behavior.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project tackles the challenge of predicting hotel bookings using a large dataset of user searches. We perform:

- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Feature engineering (time-based, distance, categoricals)
- Visual data analysis
- Neural network model training using Keras
- Evaluation using AUC (ROC)

The final goal is to predict the probability of booking for each search instance.

## 📂 Dataset

Due to size constraints, the dataset is not included in the repo. You can download it via Google Drive:
